# Contrib

This repository stores snapshots and pointers to Brick extensions, tools and other supplementary materials that have not been incorporated into the official repositories, or have not been developed or completely vetted by the core Brick team. Guidelines for how to handle the publication, documentation and maintenance of the contents of `contrib` will evolve over time. For now:

- please submit pull requests to this repository with your contributions included under a folder named for your organization, where appropriate
- please include tests, documentation with your contribution to help other users understand how to incorporate your extensions or use your tools
- please include a LICENSE file describing how your code is licensed
- (optionally) add a remote repository as a submodule to this repository. We will soon devise a mechanism to keep these remote submodules up to date
